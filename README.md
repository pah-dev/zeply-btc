# Zeply BTC Explorer

## A simple app which retrieves address and transaction information from the BTC blockchain.

### Hosted in Firebase: https://zeply-btc.web.app/

### To run project: `npm run start`

### Things to improve:

- Save favorites in a database
- Better error handling
- Golbal config.
- Notifications
- Navigation

### To save the search logs I used an API that I already had developed with NestJs and MongoDB, I just added some endpoints. This is the repository: https://github.com/pah-dev/api-data-rctrl
